# text-mining
Projects with anylysis regarding text mining.

POPULAR FILMS TWEETS 

The project presents tweets analysis of 2 popular films: “Inception” and “Spiderman”. Tweets were downloaded in November 2021. 
For the text-mining I applied methods such as removing step words, stemming, cleaning text, removing emojis etc.
The code was written in python. Analysis was carried out using packages such as nltk, numpy, pandas and seaborn.
The aim of the project is to visualize the most common words in tweets. I have created barplots and wordmaps. 
In the end I also presented the most popular common words. I attached also datasets, that I used.
